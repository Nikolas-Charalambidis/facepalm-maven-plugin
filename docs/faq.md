# FAQ

## Why did my build fail?

The **Facepalm Maven Plugin** found a potential secret (API key, password, token) in your project. By default, it fails the build if any finding reaches the `errorThreshold` (default: 80).

**What to do?**
1. Check the console logs. Facepalm will show the file and line number.
2. If it's a real secret: **Rotate it immediately.** Deleting it from the current commit is NOT enough if it was already pushed.
3. If it's a false positive: See below.

## How do I handle false positives?

No scanner is perfect. If Facepalm flags something that isn't a secret:

1. **Use placeholders**: Instead of a real key or a realistic-looking fake, use `${API_KEY}` or `PLACEHOLDER`. Facepalm's `PlaceholderSuppressorEvaluator` will automatically ignore these.
2. **Move to test paths**: Files in `test/`, `mock/`, or `spec/` get a significant score reduction.
3. **Add to `.gitignore`**: Facepalm reads your `.gitignore` and reduces the risk score for ignored files.
4. **Adjust Thresholds**: If Facepalm is too sensitive, you can increase the `errorThreshold` in your `pom.xml`.
5. **Add Dummy Keywords**: You can configure `dummyKeywords` in the `<evaluators>` section to tell Facepalm what to ignore.

## Performance

### Is it slow?
Facepalm is designed for speed. It uses:
- **Parallel processing**: Scans files using all available CPU cores.
- **Fast filtering**: Quickly skips binary files, large files (>5MB), and excluded directories.
- **Sisu Indexing**: Fast dependency injection and component discovery.

### Memory usage
Facepalm reads files into memory to perform regex matching. To prevent Out-Of-Memory (OOM) errors, it has a default `maxFileSizeBytes` limit (5MB). Large log files or datasets are automatically skipped.

## Does it scan my Git history?

No. Facepalm currently only scans the **working directory**. It's designed as a pre-commit shield. If you need to scan your entire Git history for past mistakes, we recommend using tools like **trufflehog** or **gitleaks**.

---

## Can I use it outside of Maven?

Yes! Facepalm includes a CLI entry point: `dev.nichar.facepalm.FacepalmCLI`.
However, it is easiest to use via the Maven goal `mvn facepalm:scan`.
